# FIT1008_Assignment1
Objectives of this practical session 
To be able to write MIPS programs involving lists, local variables, and functions. 
Note: 
• Local variables must be stored on the runtime stack. 
• For all the MIPS programs you should first implement a Python version, and work out a faithful translation into MIPS. 
  Both, the Python and MIPS code are required for your prac to be marked. 
  However, Python solutions alone do not result in any marks, all exercises are about MIPS and MIPS solutions are required 
  in all exercises to achieve more than 0 marks. 
• Use only instructions on the MIPS reference sheet and use comments to document each piece of code.
